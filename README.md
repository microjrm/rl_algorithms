# ml-reinforcement-learning

This repo contains the original code for this project written via jupyter notebooks.  This code was converted into a small module to easily run and reproduce for the graders. In order to reproduce the results from this notebook please follow these steps:
    
    1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/microjrm/rl_algorithms.git`
    2. Navigate to the cloned folder and create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv venv` and load the virtual environment (`source venv/bin/activate`)
    3. Execute `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.  This should install all the dependencies for this module.
    4. You should be able to run the main file from the command line using `python3 main.py`. 

Additional comments for this code can be found in the jupyter notebooks.  Those can always be used to fall back on in the event the python script fails to execute.
